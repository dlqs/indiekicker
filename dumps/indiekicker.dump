Sometimes they look red and juicy in the store, but at the first bite you realize, this is not what you expected - just water without any taste. But even if you were lucky and get tasty strawberries, you dont exactly know where they were grown. Very often they travel hundreds of miles from the field to the store. Not only that they arent fresh any more, traveling your fruits that far is not what you want to do to the environment.	food	25000	2018-10-10	2018-12-31
