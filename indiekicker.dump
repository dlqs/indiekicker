It took us another whole year to develop ATOM with a lot of fantastic improvements as you can see. For this revolutionary product, we are very careful on every stage of the R&D and production progress, and have spent a lot of time on testing and evaluation. Right now, we successfully pushed it into production stage, and we are busy working on preparing enough stock in order to ship the orders as soon as we can. 	75000	2018-10-05	2018-11-30	\N

Its futuristic design fascinates people around the world and is currently winning all major design awards. A simple shift of the cap unlocks the pen and makes it ready for writing. All parts of KOSMOS are processed from a solid block of high-grade metals, like titanium or aluminium. The result is a durable, perfectly functional writing utensil with the exceedingly rare look of quality.	100000	2018-10-05	2018-12-28	\N
